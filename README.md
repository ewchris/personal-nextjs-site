This was an attempt at creating a personal page using nextjs. I'm abandoning the project as I'm just not having fun with nextjs.

I'm finding that certain things in nextjs are overly complicated, and in some cases nextjs has reinvented the wheel on common web standards so that the standard can't be used and you must use nextjs' implementation of web standards(metadata, etc). Also, I've heard that nextjs is better for projects since the learning curve is quite low compared to Angular. I've done two tutorials in nextjs and I still feel like I don't know anything about the framework. If I'm going to need to spend many hours figuring out a framework, I would rather use my experience in Angular.

Maybe react on it's own might be better, or paired with a more lighter weight framework instead of nextjs. I've heard remix might be better ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
